<p>The script takes Purchase Request in excel format and converts it into Purchase Order printed into PDF file which is the final file to be sent over to a supplier. In the meantime, script saves and tracks down the request details for the further analysis or audits.</p>
<p>The script includes algorithm to generate the Purchase Order number (first tracker's column) so that it can be unique and not duplicate previous ones.</p>
<p>miniERP excel handles also back-end dabase of vendors and ordering company data that is being printed on Purchase Order.</p>
